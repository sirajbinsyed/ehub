The eHub Project is a Python Flask-based web application designed to facilitate the booking of charging slots for electric vehicles, as well as manage vehicle pickups and reviews. Built on the robust Flask framework, eHub provides a streamlined experience for users, administrators, and charging companies through three key modules:

1) Admin Module: Oversees platform operations, manages users and charging companies, monitors transactions, and ensures smooth service delivery.
2) User Module: Allows electric vehicle owners to find, reserve, and pay for charging slots conveniently. Users can also schedule vehicle pickups and leave reviews, enhancing 
   service quality and transparency.
3) Charging Company Module: Enables charging station operators to list their stations, manage bookings, track reviews, and connect with EV users seamlessly.
