The eHub Project is an innovative solution designed to streamline and simplify the process of booking charging slots for electric vehicles while also offering pickup and review services. With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, the eHub platform addresses the need for accessible and reliable charging station management. The project consists of three core modules:

1) Admin Module: Oversees platform operations, manages users and charging companies, monitors transactions, and ensures smooth service delivery.
2) User Module: Allows electric vehicle owners to find, reserve, and pay for charging slots conveniently. Users can also schedule vehicle pickups and leave reviews, enhancing 
   service quality and transparency.
3) Charging Company Module: Enables charging station operators to list their stations, manage bookings, track reviews, and connect with EV users seamlessly.
